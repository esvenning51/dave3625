<b>For this assignment I chose to try the task of predicting the stock price of NAS.
  Because we are supposed to predict the price as a number (continuous value, not buy/sell) this would be a problem for regression (not classification).
  Will use linear regression from the sklearn library. Since this is an intro course I chose the simplest model to be sure to understand what is going on.
  
  *Had a small problem with predicting for "date", but made a function that predicts price at X trading days after last day in the set.
